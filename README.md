# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Create a DataFrame summary for PyBer, a ride-sharing company, to compare weekly fares for January 2019 to the end of April 2019, for each type of city. Data will include total rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver and total fare by city type.

## Summary
Rural cities show the fewest trips with the fewest number of drivers.  However the average fare per ride and driver are well above the suburban and urban cities.  This may be due to longer distances being traveled.  Urban citites have the highest amount of drivers with 2,405 but with only a total of 1,625 total rides.  Urban cities also have the lowest average fare per ride and driver.
